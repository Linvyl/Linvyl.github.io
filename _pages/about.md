I am an AI researcher working on **vision--language models**, **multimodal learning**, and **document understanding**, with a particular focus on **text-rich images** and **visual question answering**.

I received my B.Sc. in Information and Communication Technology from the University of Science and Technology of Hanoi (USTH). My research experience includes work at the Institute of Information Technology (IOIT), Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, and AI VIETNAM (AIVN), where I contributed to projects on visual question answering and multimodal reasoning.

My research has led to publications at international venues, including **ICCV Workshops (VisionDocs 2025)** and **AAAI Workshop on Document Understanding and Intelligence (2025)**.

I am currently preparing applications for graduate study and am broadly interested in robust and practical multimodal AI systems.
